# qa-selenium-webdriver-factory
A library to ease the development of Selenium's powered automation framework by instantiating a web driver and reducing boilerplate code.

## Features
### Supported Browsers
* Brave Browser (uses ChromeDriver) (* see knowledge base section)
* Chrome Browser

### Supported Platform
* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 21.10)
* Windows (tested on Windows 10)

# Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit / Runtime Environment (Java 11)
* Lombok (**IMPORTANT** please follow the instruction to install Lombok on [Eclipse, Spring Tool Suite, (Red Hat) JBoss Developer Studio, MyEclipse](https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij), [Netbean](https://projectlombok.org/setup/netbeans), 
and [Visual Studio Code](https://projectlombok.org/setup/vscode).
* Selenium Webdriver (uses version 4.1.2)

# Developer(s)

# Knowledge Base

* If you get Java error(s) on getters/setters, you haven't installed the Lombok plugin on your IDE. This library is required to use qa-selenium-webdriver-factory. After installing the plugin, make sure to perform a Maven update.
* Brave Browser on Linux (local): Feature flagged as experimental. There's an issue when webDriver.quit() is called. I recommend executing Brave driver on a Windows host or remotely (through Selenium Grid hosted on Windows 
(* tested and works fine)).
