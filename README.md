# Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit / Runtime Environment (Java 11)
* Lombok (**IMPORTANT** please follow the instruction to install Lombok on [Eclipse, Spring Tool Suite, (Red Hat) JBoss Developer Studio, MyEclipse](https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij), [Netbean](https://projectlombok.org/setup/netbeans), 
and [Visual Studio Code](https://projectlombok.org/setup/vscode).

# Knowledge Base

* If you get Java error(s) on getters/setters, you haven't installed the Lombok plugin on your IDE. This library is required to use qa-selenium-webdriver-factory. After installing the plugin, make sure to perform a Maven update.
* Brave Browser on Linux (local): Not supported. I recommend executing Brave Browser on a Windows host or remotely (through Selenium Grid hosted on Windows 
(* tested and works fine)).
* Opera Browser on Linux (local): Not supported. I recommend executing Opera Browser on a Windows host or remotely (through Selenium Grid hosted on Windows 
(* tested and works fine)).
